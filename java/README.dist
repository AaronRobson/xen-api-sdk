XenServerJava
=============

Version @SDK_VERSION@

XenServerJava is a complete SDK for Citrix XenServer, exposing the XenServer
API as Java classes.

It is available in the XenServer-SDK-@SDK_VERSION@.zip, which can be downloaded
from http://www.citrix.com/downloads/xenserver/.

For XenServer documentation see http://docs.citrix.com.
XenServerJava includes a class for every XenServer class, and a method for
each XenServer API call, so API documentation and examples written for
for other languages will apply equally well to Java.
In particular, the SDK Guide and API Documentation are ideal for developers
wishing to use XenServerJava.
