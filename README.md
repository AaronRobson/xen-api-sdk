XenAPI Software Development Kit
===============================

This repository contains the generation code for the XenAPI Software Development
Kit (SDK) and its associated documentation and examples.

The generated SDK consists of five components, one for each of C, C#, Java,
PowerShell and Python, exposing the individual XenAPI calls as first-class
functions in the target language.

The generation code is mostly written in
[Ocaml](http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/) 3.12.
