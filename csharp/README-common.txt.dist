XenServer.NET
=============

Version @SDK_VERSION@

XenServer.NET is a complete SDK for Citrix XenServer,
exposing the XenServer API as .NET classes. It is written in C#.

For XenServer documentation, see http://docs.xensource.com.
XenServer.NET includes a class for every XenServer class, and a method for
each XenServer API call, so API documentation and examples written for
for other languages will apply equally well to .NET.
In particular, the SDK Guide and API Documentation are ideal for developers
wishing to use XenServer.NET.
